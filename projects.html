        A code where the user is able to drag their mouse around the screen in order to leave a trace of colored dots.
        <br>
        This project was shorter than expected. It required a lot of imports. The creation of functions is also something that was repeated in the code. I used only three colors to make the code easier, however using more would look really nice

      <p>A code using CMU Graphics to create an avatar.
        <br>
      This project was more simple than it seems! I got to use a graph to help with positioning the different shapes for my avatar. I decided to create a cat because I love cats and I love how cute yet minimalistic it looks! I would love to do something like this again.
